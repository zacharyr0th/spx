# Liquidity Analysis Utility for SPX Fair Value Calculation

## Purpose
This repository serves as a central location for utility methods used in liquidity analysis. These methods are designed to calculate fair value formulas for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) based on the analysis of public liquidity reports released by the FED and Treasury Department.

## Application
The primary use of these utility methods is to facilitate trading of SPX derivatives through the identification and analysis of statistical imbalances in liquidity data. The FED's open market activities in 2020/2021 had a substantial impact on the correlation between liquidity and SPX's price, leading to a strong synchronization between the two. Consequently, this approach has proven to be effective in generating comparatively accurate forecasts of SPX's fair value by factoring in the underlying liquidity dynamics.

## Context
As this strategy has grown in popularity over the last few years, there is a risk of it creating crowded trades. To stay ahead of the curve and "frontrun the frontrunners", this repo is dedicated to storing works in progress that contribute to a unique calculation of SPX fair value.
