# Liquidity Analysis Utility for SPX Fair Value Calculation

## Purpose
This repository serves as a central location for utility methods used in liquidity analysis. These methods are designed to calculate fair value formulas for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) based on the analysis of public liquidity reports released by the FED and Treasury Department.

## Application
The primary application of these utility methods is to enable trading of SPX derivatives by identifying and analyzing statistical imbalances in liquidity data. The correlation between liquidity and SPX's price has been significantly influenced by the FED's open market activities in 2020/2021, which has caused them to move largely in tandem. As a result, this approach has enabled relatively accurate forecasting of SPX's fair value by taking into account the underlying liquidity dynamics.

## Context
As this strategy has grown in popularity over the last few years, there is a risk of it creating crowded trades. To stay ahead of the curve and "frontrun the frontrunners", this repo is dedicated to storing works in progress that contribute to a unique calculation of SPX fair value.
